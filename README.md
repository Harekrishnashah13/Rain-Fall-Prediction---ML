# 🌧️ Rain Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether it will rain tomorrow based on weather-related features. Using the **weatherAUS** dataset, the notebook walks through the process of data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison using multiple algorithms.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Rain can significantly impact agriculture, transportation, and daily human activities. Accurately predicting rainfall helps in planning and mitigating risks. This project utilizes historical weather data to classify whether it will rain the next day (`RainTomorrow`).

## 📈 Key Steps
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Imported dataset and set up display settings for better readability.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identified numerical, categorical, continuous, and discrete features.
   - Investigated missing values and feature distributions.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Categorical encoding
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling
   - Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Trained multiple classifiers.
   - Evaluated performance using:
     - Accuracy
     - Confusion Matrix
     - Classification Report

5. **Model Comparison**
   - Compared models based on performance metrics to determine the best-performing model for rainfall prediction.
